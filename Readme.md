# Description

This repository shows how to use project [fl-darkstat](https://github.com/darklab8/fl-darkstat) (Online flstat)
for automated build of static assets and deployment to github pages

The example is shown on game data from [Freelancer Discovery](https://discoverygc.com/)
Same data is used for unit testing of [fl-darkstat](https://github.com/darklab8/fl-darkstat), [fl-configs](https://github.com/darklab8/fl-configs) and [fl-darklint](https://github.com/darklab8/fl-darklint)

# Deployment steps

Your repository should be containing minimal file amount needed for fl-stat

And it could use CI workflow for autodeployment similar to [shown example](./.github/workflows/publish.yaml)
Instead of deploying to github pages, you can deploy to any other target capable to server static assets (html/css/js)
Alternatively fl-darkstat is usable locally, see its repository for more information
