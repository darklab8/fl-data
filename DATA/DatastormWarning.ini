[DSWarning]
HeadLine = Discovery Datastorm Warning
OK = I don't like playing this game
Cancel = Wait... let me search myself
Text = Discovery does not contain any secrets so well-hidden that you'll never be able to find them in-game. This mod 
tries to be logical in placement of bases, jump holes, and wrecks. So please search yourself, and if you search well, 
you'll find everything without spoiling the game with the Datastorm. For your own enjoyment!
As an alternative, you may always visit our forums at http://discoverygc.com and ask members about what you wanted to 
find, or simply log on to our server and ask other players.
I hope you are capable of playing fair.
Igiss
