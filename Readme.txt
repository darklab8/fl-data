1. THE STORYLINE
=================
It is the year 822 A.S., and with it comes Bretonia's darkest hour. The house Gallia begins their assault on Sirius in earnest by brushing aside the Bretonian Armed Forces and seizing the Leeds system, changing the political landscape of Sirius forever. Governments and regional powers far and wide now seek to respond to the situation, either by launching themselves toward a desperate united front against a seemingly unstoppable enemy, or seeking to use the resulting chaos for their own benefit.

Liberty is in the process of the biggest mobilisation in its history. Rheinland's gambit of blowing the gates in the face of a Libertonian advance has made the leadership of Liberty focus on the greater foe: a great portion of the Liberty Navy fleet is now on the move to Magellan to catch the advancing Royal Navy of Gallia in a pinch. But is the war between Rheinland and Liberty really over, or is the Rheinland Military merely trying to lull the Libertonians into complacency?

Rheinland's plan has definitely brought them a much needed respite. While their overall defence held against any Libertonian incursions, the Munster research facility was lost and the data it held captured. Rheinland is now faced with a prospect of a counter push against a stronger enemy, so that they can regain what they have lost. But even at home troubles multiply: Rheinland's revolutionary movements seized the opportunity before them and struck at a Rheinland whose Military was off fighting at a distant front. The Dresden system has been taken by storm in a show of defiance, and the Rheinland government now has to choose between attempting to solve problems at home first, or committing resources to the pursuit of the stolen Munster base module, before it can disappear deep within Area 21.

Meanwhile in Bretonia a mass exodus takes place: as core planets begin to fall to an enemy far stronger than the previously hostile Kusari Empire, the Bretonian government attempts to evacuate as many people and as much materiel as possible to the newly annexed system of Omega-3. While the Bretonian navy is pushed out of Leeds, the Cambridge fleet pushes into orbit of Planet Sprague, now functioning as the refugee camp of Bretonia. With thousands of civilians and armed forces personnel still trapped on Planet Leeds, the Bretonian government issues an order to all able citizens of the house to assist with the smuggling of these people and the materiel that they guard off of Leeds, under the noses of the patrolling Gallia Royal Navy. But with all the focus on shipping all valuable stocks to the rear there are many opportunities for an enterprising pirate or freedom fighter: the Mollys relocate closer to Omega-3 to hit these transports as a priority, and Corsairs become an even more frequent sighting in the ice clouds of Cambridge. The Bretonians will have to carefully consider how many forces they are committing to the defence of these shipments. Not enough defenders could spell disaster for the refugees on Sprague, but too many may mean that the Royal Navy begins to threaten the seat of power in New London sooner than expected.

Despite the chaos in the south, the newly founded Kusari Republic tends to its own problems, wrecked by years of war and a defiant imperial administration. Contrary to Liberty and Bretonia, the republican government pursues a policy of appeasement with Gallia, seeking greater trade ties to rebuilt its coffers through the resource hungry Gallic state. But while to an outsider the new, non partisan government would seem to have put an end to the struggles between Kusari big business, new troubles are simmering under the surface. Samura executives and rich families are non too happy about their influence eroding away, and they still have more than enough support among the populace to begin stirring up unrest. In response, Kishiro begins to once again work closer together with the greatly rising GMG. Kusari republicans will have their work cut out for them, having not only a political balancing act on their hands, but also the task of rebuilding the economy. They need to tread carefully, as mistakes may once again plunge the House of Kusari into the depths of civil war.

No matter the distance from Gallia, all of Sirius is feeling the effect of the Gallic invasion. Those who see the coming shifts in power, prepare themselves to seize their opportunity from the chaos ahead. Those who are not as farsighted, will be doomed to a desperate defence against these seekers of glory. One thing is for certain: the conquest has only begun.

2. GENERAL INFORMATION
======================

Discovery Freelancer 4.88.6 is a product of over 21 months of work. As always, describing everything that has been done is next to impossible due to the vast amount of changes, both big and small. However, this readme will provide some information to help you understand the scale of the mod and help you enjoy Discovery 4.88.

Some initial points to consider:
- Discovery uses its own installer since version 4.86, FLMM is no longer neccessary. 
- Installing mods ontop of Discovery 4.88 will most likely have unwanted effects. It will also result in not being able to join most 4.88 servers.
- Open SP is always enabled, Campaign SP has been removed for compatibility reasons. Attempts to load campaign save files will result in errors.
- Do not forget to transfer internal equipment (ID and scanner) each time when you buy a new ship.
- ID items present in Discovery act as tractor beams.
- If your large ship gets stuck while undocking from certain space stations, try moving backward and strafing, use thruster, use the /stuck command or log off and on again.
- If you are automatically kicked from multiplayer servers, check your ship loadout for equipment that's no longer mountable on this ship.
- Goto the discoverygc.com forums if you have any questions. Read server rules if you play on multiplayer servers. And, last but not least, enjoy the game!

Discovery 4.88 is the fourth version of the mod that was developed from the start by the Discovery Development Team, a dedicated group of 3D and 2D artists, coders, designers, writers, and testers.

This version of the mod has been designed primarily to deliver much needed progress to the storyline. Many systems have been changed, some removed and some merged. It was the development team's intent to build on the lore of as many factions in the game as it was possible.

But the storyline is not everything. The dev team has done all in its power to improve the gameplay flow in many systems, and the storyline was driven in such a way as to provide as many opportunities for roleplay as possible, while also not breaking established lore. To further deliver better gameplay, many balance changes have been made (specifically to fighters) in order to improve the flow of PvP fights, so that they can in the end become more interesting and intense than they are right now.

And of course it wouldn't be a Discovery release if we didn't have many new or improved ship models ready for you to discover and enjoy yourself in. Many talented modellers have submitted exceptional work which further enhances the quality of the mod, and will allow for a far more immersive experience.

The economy has been revamped once again, with not only many new commodities being added, but the economy specifically designed to support the needs of base builders. Realistic chains of material harvesting, refining, manufacturing and retailing now exist. There are more than enough trade (or smuggling) opportunities for any hauler out there.

To give a fuller sense of immersion into the dangerous Sirius sector, NPCs throughout the entirety of the mod have been updated to feature better weaponry, but also fewer numbers. No longer will NPCs appear to die in droves, instead small patrols of NPCs will be something to be aware of. Capital worlds will also be properly protected by specially outfitted defenders, to enforce safety in the core worlds.

The integrated Discovery automatic updater will allow for easy, secure and rapid updating with no manual file transfering. Each time the game is launched, it checks with the server if new updates are available. Updates are cumulative (you don't have to download all of them, just the latest one). 

If automatic update fails, you can download standalone update packages from our forums (http://discoverygc.com). The updater does not restrict offline play, and you will still be able to play single-player or on a local LAN server without an internet connection.

If you prefer online play, you are welcome to join the official Discovery Freelancer RP 24/7 server and a number of other servers running Discovery. Server operators are welcome to run Discovery 4.86 without any restrictions. 

In January 2007, Discovery mod was chosen to receive the Simulation Genre Award of ModDB.com's Mod of the Year-2006 contest (MOTY-2006).

- Tweaked Dublin. Edited Poole so it becomes a non-guard system hooked by jumpgate to Cambridge. And a source of Sairs too
- Added Xeno base to Minnesota
- Tweaked the Commsat model so it has the ability to be docked at. Created a "docking ring" using this model, to simulate docking on a planet without using a docking ring (snubs only)

- Adjustments to the asteroid exclusion zones in Chugoku

- Fix to the Mastodon ship icon on the shipdealer - it was upside down
- Fis to the Silver commodity icon, sometimes it doesn't properly display.

- Name change: Colonial Forces -> Colonial Military

- Created Gallic Small Transport Turret, and assigned it to Toulouse, New Paris and Lodeve. Stats are equal to the other Small Transport Turrets.

- Updated Inverness rumors and base population.
- Minor fixes to Tau39, Verpucci

- Balance tweaks to the Bretonian destroyer and the Scylla. Both get a small buff.
- Balance tweaks to the HF and Liberty cruiser primary. Small damage buff. HF gun also takes more energy.

- Various tweaks and fixes to the Hook plugins (playerbase mainly) by Cannon.
- Modified vanilla fighter SURs, assigning all componentry to the root. This prevents some fighters from being nearly unhittable on certain angles (especially Kusari and Blood Dragon VHFs).
- Reverted some changes to the trade lane and jumpgate models to see if that fixes docking issues
- Reduced complexity on (nearly) all non-vanilla ship SURs. Hopefully this will beef server performance by quite a bit.

- Thor and Unioner bomber stats tweaked.
- Molly rumors for Cambridge fixed.

- Fixes to the Tundra model after reports the front cannon doesn't show on scans.
- Minor changes to Omicron 85 and Omicron 100. 85 gets some proper exclusion zones, 100 gets some buoys to mark the paths through the roids.
- Rheinland gunboat now drops all cargo on exploding.
- Created a better model and loadout for the playerbase turret. There are two additional loadouts in the planning, for now only the "balanced" one is available (antifighter and long range are pending implementation)
- Fix to Nomad Liar model - big ships had issues docking to it. It now uses the spoke on the elongated end of the egg shape to dock ships to. Just aim for the shield generator and hit F3.
- Nomad thruster removed from Primus. No monkeying around with those.
- Removed USI trade encounters from the lanes in New Berlin and Hamburg. Not sure what those were still doing there, aside from getting blown up.

- Installer updated to support non-English Freelancer copies.

- Updated to include Cyrillic patch for windows 7.
- Corrected a hardpoint issue with a prop object. Seems a vanilla glitch. 
- Corrected an invalid lootcrate appearance. Probably a typo.
- Updated a few internal infocards - these are the names assigned to ship hardpoints on the ship interface. IE "Freighter Shield Class10" is now "Battleship Shield". Mainly done to prevent a lot of confusion when the lesser shield hardpoints ...
- Added and changed the dock cam and launch cam for the Bret Battleship - the old positions were horrible.
- Minor adjustment to the encounters, and removing an unused encounter template that's never going to be used (Kusari capital ships - Exiles do not use battleship patrols).
- Adjusted fighter loadouts: Reduced the amount of countermeasures in the ships hold. A lot of ships had 20 basic countermeasures, reduced to 4 to prevent clutter in space. NPCs don't tend to use these anyway.
- Adjustments to the Kusari capital ship encounters to include the battlecruiser.
- Rebalanced Slaves profit margins.
- Fixed a few light hardpoints and recentered some other hardpoints on lane nodes. Should improve functionality of the Sirian lane, and visual of the gallic lane.

- Slightly moved engine hardpoint to improve how the engine effect displays.

- Fix for Corsair Ossies drop no loot. Missiongrinders are unhappy. Changed the _NL version to the player version for the NPC ship instance.
- BS in Rousillion should be redemption, not Valor. Swapped out the object archetype and loadout to the Redemption. Tested in openSP, no issues found.
- TLAGsnet adjusted. GRP has TLAGSNET in Burgundy and Dauphine.
- Texture issue in the Uruz model. Also recentered the model and recreated the SUR after centering. Tested in openSP, no issues found.
- SUR adjustment after the model was altered (and recentered as a result). Centering issue, no resize was done.
- Bugfix to the Anki. Also sorted out some texture issues and compressed the texture files into a single file for the entire line - no need to have the same textures across 3 seperate files. Also ensured these texture names are un...
- Fixed a spelling bug to the vanilla Valkyrie infocard.
- Docking fixture on Toulouse didn't have it's reputation set. Fixed.

- Corrected a faulty texture reference for the "Green Water" planet.
- Changes to Dabadorou station NPC population.
- Fixing several root mesh name collisions - this should for example fix the Touketsu appearing as a Mastodon.

- Corrected several issues with missing hardpoints being assigned equipment.
- Fix for Pachyderme docking lights not oriented properly.
- Rheinland battleship default loadout light hardpoint issue. Fixed one hardpoint missing a light assigned to it. Also changed the hardpoint orientation.

- Fixed Gallic luxury liner docking issues.
- Small adjustment to Hamburg: The second Frankfurt hole was outside the Wedel roidfield. Corrected this by extending the roidfield.
- Shield perimiter fix, part 1. Model shield hardpoints added so that radius bubbles can cover the entire model.
- Reverted techcompat to 0.91 from 1.0 for all allies guns. Updated MM and Reaver techcompat based on most recent information and ruling.

- Toplita NPC population (junker) was using LSF uniforms. Corrected.
- Sancerre: Scrap field overlapping trade lane, exclusion zone adjusted.
- Miningmod tweak: Helium3 price at South Shields halved, additional high buy point added at Southampton. Reason: Pirates robbing folk in Tau 31 and selling at South Shields at full price, undesired behaviour.
- Sancerre mining base component misalignment fixed.
- Massive update to virtually all system files. File structures sorted for easier future editing. Light sources tied to their owning suns, they were not on the star in many cases. All planets given a weak rotation and tilt.
- Changed Good Sell/Bad Buy to 1.1 for all Jump Drive and Survey Modules so they don't show up in the list of commodities purchased at the base in the F9 window. It was as annoying as it was useless.
- Fixed Kusari Big Dragon infocard xml errors
- Removed KNF bribe from Planet New Paris. Removed GRN bribes everywhere. Whoops, forgot that my template didn't distinguish GRN from any other faction when mbases entries were initially created.

- Adjusted mission logic. Bigger reward missions are now available for daring players who enjoy fighting capital NPCs
- Adjusted capital ship pilot logic. They won't hold back with their primaries and solaris anymore. They will also break formation in missions, engaging individually. Should make them more challenging
- Reduced hitbox complexity of capital ship/station turrets and several high-poly capital ships, to help combat lag
- Tweaked the texturing of the Renzu fighter line. It had some conflicts with legacy textures
- Lightsources (for pimpship and NPC ship package design): Expanded all colors to have all types (strobe, big lights, small lights etc).
- Fixed some issues with the Marauder model being off-center
- Adjusted Pelican ship package - lights weren't all being applied
- Adjusted Sirian jump gate docking sequence to prevent big transports from getting stuck on them
- Corrected exclusion zone around the Frankfurt hole in Dresden
- Corrected exclusion zone around Helgoland in Sigma 13
- Applied some heavier defenses to Omega 5, on both sides. Cruiser defense near the bases, and gunboat patrols in the Hammen hole
- Increased exclusion zone size around Newgate after reports that transports would sometimes undock into the mines. Also put a banner exclusion for that zone, so mines don't appear to be there and then disappear
- Adjusted NPC spawning around Newgate to prevent NPCs from getting stuck.
- Fixed a misaligned component for the Maquis base in Rousillion
- Loadout adjustments to a lot of NPCs. This should fix SPEW errors referring to items not being found, and reduce clutter in space.
- Removed Conneticut/NY jumphole. Transfer will be handled by a hook plugin.
- Many changes to the Frankfurt system. Should hopefully make that more pleasant and make it feel fuller.
- Fixed the animation script of the Manufacturing Platform model (industrial base component, with the 3 chimneys). It won't jerk it's rotating component every 30 seconds.
- Fixed reps between Kusari Exiles and the Bretonian folk. KuEx going hostile will no longer trigger Brets going hostile.
- Moved Nagasaki a fair distance from Stokes - just barely out of range of it's main weapons. This should allow people to safely dock/undock from that base.
- Several Gallic systems: Minimap updates to paint nebulas with the proper color.
- Tau 44: A few GRN NPCs were not in uniform, fixed
- Provence: A few UC NPCs were mislabeled as Brigands. Fixed.
- A few CR infocards were displaying the formatting code due to errors in the formatting. Fixed.
- Asco hitbox: Adjusted the crosshair location to be in the middle of the "fat" part of it. Should make aiming by crosshair on these boats a lot easier.
- Dublin: Adjusted encounters, put in some limitations  to them. Also added a third gold field and adjusted the sizes of the other two.
- Omega 49: Limitations to the number of NPCs areas can spawn. Also toned down the level of NPCs in the area (18 -> 16).

- Ship and equipment sold in Tau-117 altered at the request of the Wilde faction to blend more with the new natives.
- Fixed a bug with a planetsphere raduis not being set correctly. Affects planet Chateauroux in Berry.
- Fixed a number of guns that weren't set as nonlootable but should be. Affects Phantom, a few Guard guns and a bunch of transport and cap turrets.
- Nomad light fighters couldn't do 400m/s. Had to define a new engine for them since practically all Nomad fighters use the same engine. Affects Nomad LF and Morph.
- Adjusted cargo-to-scan-for to not demand pilots not belonging to a faction or direct allies. Else you get stuff like BHG shooting LPI.
- Zoner Whale power core swapped out with the standard transport power core. This'll allow it to fire a heavy CM while in cruise.
